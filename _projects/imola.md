**Status:** Ongoing (2024-Present)

## Overview

IMOLA focuses on developing automated methods for extracting road networks from maps and converting them into routable graph structures. This project addresses the challenge of digitizing transportation infrastructure from diverse cartographic sources.

## Research Contributions

- **Deep-learning methods for road network extraction**: Developing methods for detecting road centerlines, intersections, bridges, and other linear transportation features across varying cartographic styles
- **Topology reconstruction algorithms**: Building algorithms to convert raw line predictions into routable graph structures with nodes and edges classification and connectivity correction
- **Evaluation pipelines**: Designing comprehensive evaluation pipelines to assess extraction quality across large heterogeneous map collections with patch difficulty modeling, structured error attribution, and cross-region generalization metrics

## Technical Approach

The project combines computer vision techniques with graph-based methods to handle the complexity of map digitization, ensuring robust performance across different map styles and geographic regions.
