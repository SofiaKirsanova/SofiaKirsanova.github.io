**Co-PIs:** Dr. Yao-Yi Chiang (UMN), Dr. Stefan Leyk (CU Boulder)  
**Status:** Ongoing (2024 -- 2027)

## Overview

IMOLA (Intelligent Map recOgnition LAb) is a large-scale NSF project focused on extracting, digitizing, and analyzing historical U.S. road networks from **178,000+ USGS topographic map sheets (1884–2006)**.  
The core goal is to build **US1884+**, a comprehensive spatiotemporal database of attributed road networks with uncertainty measures, enabling research across geography, history, urban development, demography, and environmental change.

By converting scanned maps into GIS-ready vector and raster layers, IMOLA unlocks historical landscape information that predates satellite imagery, supporting long-term studies of urbanization, infrastructure development, and population change.

## Main Research Contributions

- **US1884+ historical road network database**  
  A national, multi-temporal dataset of vector and raster road layers with feature-level uncertainty for 120+ years of U.S. history.  
- **DaVinci map processing system**  
  Development of advanced computer vision capabilities (LCA, LDTR, contextual learning, multimodal knowledge fusion) for automatic line extraction with reduced manual annotation requirements.  
- **Uncertainty modeling framework**  
  Processing-, production-, and application-related uncertainty analysis for trustworthy spatiotemporal inference.  
- **Case studies & community integration**  
  Demonstrations connecting historical road networks with population change, land-use, settlement expansion, flooding risk, and environmental exposure research.

## Technical Approach

IMOLA integrates deep learning, contextual reasoning, and geospatial knowledge graphs:

- Automatic training data generation using **Label Correction Algorithm (LCA)** for weakly supervised learning.
- **LDTR (Linear Detection Transformer)** for high-connectivity line extraction and vector graph reconstruction.
- Prior-knowledge fusion through **context-aware multimodal learning** and semantic spatial rules.
- Scalable processing and dissemination through the **DaVinci** pipeline, Docker distribution, open data portals, and GIS tutorials.

All outputs will be publicly accessible through the project website, Harvard Dataverse, and UMN U-Spatial.

## Impact

IMOLA enables the first nationwide historical road network time series spanning 100+ years, supporting:

- Urban growth and transportation evolution studies  
- Demographic change modeling and historical settlement analysis  
- Landscape & environmental research, hazards, and climate studies  
- Long-term spatial data integration with census, land cover, and building datasets

The project lowers barriers to using historical cartographic archives and establishes foundational infrastructure for large-scale spatiotemporal research across social, behavioral, environmental, and geospatial sciences.
