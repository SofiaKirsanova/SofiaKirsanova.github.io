## Overview

IMOLA (Intelligent Map Object Line Analysis) is an NSF-funded project focused on developing automated methods for extracting road networks from maps and converting them into routable graph structures. This project addresses the critical challenge of digitizing transportation infrastructure from diverse cartographic sources, enabling large-scale analysis of historical and contemporary map collections.

## Research Contributions

- **Deep-learning methods for road network extraction**: Developing state-of-the-art methods for detecting road centerlines, intersections, bridges, and other linear transportation features across varying cartographic styles, scales, and geographic regions
- **Topology reconstruction algorithms**: Building robust algorithms to convert raw line predictions into routable graph structures with accurate node and edge classification, connectivity correction, and geometric refinement
- **Evaluation pipelines**: Designing comprehensive evaluation pipelines to assess extraction quality across large heterogeneous map collections, including patch difficulty modeling, structured error attribution, and cross-region generalization metrics

## Technical Approach

The project combines advanced computer vision techniques (including vision transformers and multimodal learning) with graph-based methods to handle the complexity of map digitization. The approach ensures robust performance across different map styles, scales, and geographic regions, making it applicable to diverse cartographic materials from historical archives to modern digital maps.

## Impact

IMOLA aims to enable large-scale digitization of transportation networks, supporting applications in urban planning, transportation analysis, historical research, and geospatial intelligence. The automated extraction methods significantly reduce the time and effort required for manual digitization while maintaining high accuracy standards.
