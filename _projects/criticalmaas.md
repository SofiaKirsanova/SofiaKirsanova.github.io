**Sponsor:** DARPA CriticalMAAS  
**Advisor:** Dr. Yao-Yi Chiang  
**Status:** Completed (2024-2025)

## Overview

CriticalMAAS developed automated methods for detecting and parsing legend information from historical maps, contributing to the DIGMAPPER map-digitization pipeline.

## Research Contributions

- **Deep-learning methods for legend detection**: Developed methods for detecting legend symbols and text regions and linking them into structured legend items across diverse cartographic styles
- **Multimodal approach**: Combined fine-tuned LayoutLMv3 with GPT-4o structured prompting for layout-aware legend parsing
- **High accuracy results**: Achieved **96%** symbol-detection F1, **97.8%** text-detection F1, and **97.1%** symbol-description linking accuracy

## Impact

This work contributed to the DIGMAPPER system, a modular framework for automated geologic map digitization, enabling large-scale processing of historical cartographic materials.
