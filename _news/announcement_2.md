Our paper "[Detecting Legend Items on Historical Maps Using GPT-4o with In-Context Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3764920.3770590)" was accepted to [GeoSearch@ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025](https://geosearch-workshop.github.io/geosearch2025/)! I'll be presenting this work at SIGSPATIAL in Minneapolis this November. See you there!
