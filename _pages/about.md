I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yao-Yi Chiang](https://yaoyichi.github.io/). I am a member of the [Knowledge Computing Lab](https://knowledge-computing.github.io/). 

My research focuses on legend analysis from map images, involving both coarse and fine legend analysis. In the coarse component, I work on segmenting map content and legend areas, analyzing model performance across different map styles, and labeling maps with suboptimal styles. In the fine component, I am training a model to detect polygon legend items and developing methods for handling more complex legend layouts.

I received a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Lomonosov Moscow State University](https://msu.ru/en/). My major was in Computer Science and Software Engineering, and my thesis was titled 'Process Analytics Methods for Anomaly Detection Tasks in System Log Data'
