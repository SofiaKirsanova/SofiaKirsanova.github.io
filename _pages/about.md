I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yao-Yi Chiang](https://yaoyichi.github.io/). I am a member of the [Knowledge Computing Lab](https://knowledge-computing.github.io/). 

My research focuses on computer vision, document image analysis, and geospatial deep learning. I work on automated digitization of maps and documents, with expertise in vision transformers, multimodal learning, and layout understanding. My current projects include:

- **IMOLA (NSF)**: Developing deep-learning methods for extracting road networks from maps, including road centerlines, intersections, and bridges, with topology reconstruction algorithms to convert predictions into routable graph structures.

- **CriticalMAAS (DARPA)**: Developed methods for detecting legend symbols and text regions on historical maps, combining LayoutLMv3 with GPT-4o for layout-aware legend parsing, achieving 96% symbol-detection F1 and 97.1% symbol-description linking accuracy.

I received a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Lomonosov Moscow State University](https://msu.ru/en/). My major was in Computer Science and Software Engineering, and my thesis was titled 'Process Analytics Methods for Anomaly Detection Tasks in System Log Data'.
